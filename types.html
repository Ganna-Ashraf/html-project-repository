<h3>The Java language</h3>The Java language is a multi platform language thatâ€™s particularly helpful in networking. Of course, mostly this language is used on the web with Java applets. However, this language is used to design cross platform programs, Since it similar to C++ in structure and syntax. For C++ programmers, Java language is very easy to learn and it offers some advantages provided by object oriented  programming. Like reusability and it can be difficult to write efficient code in Java. But, nowadays the speed of the Java language has increased and 1.5 version offers some good features for easy program making.</p>

<h3>C Language</h3>
The C language is a  basic programming language and it is a very popular language, particularly used in game programming, Because C language includes the additional packing of the C++, Every programmer uses this language because it makes programs faster . However the value of this language gives the reusability of C++ to get the slight increase in performance with C language.</p>
<p>
<h3>C++ Language</h3>
The C++ language has an object oriented structure which is used in large projects. Programmers can collaborate one program into different parts or even one individual work on each part of the program. The structure of object oriented also permit code to be reused many times.This language is an efficient language. But, many programmers will disagree</p>
<p>
<h3>Python</h3>
Python is a general-use programming language meaning that it can be used for almost anything. Python is one of the most popular programming languages among big tech giants and startups. The language is perfect for beginners because it rejects complexity and is very simple to learn. Coders who know Python would be eligible for jobs in back end development, server coding, and more. Popular sites such as Google, Pinterest, Instagram, and Dropbox were all built using Python.</p>
